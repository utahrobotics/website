                The programming team currently has a lot on our hands, so we are looking for talented individuals to join us!
                Below is an uncomprehensive list of technologies we use. Familiarity with any of them is beneficial, however,
                you do not need to know any of these if you are a strong, independent learner!
            
                Linux (working in the command line)
                ROS 2 (or ROS 1. If you know this you are already very valuable!)
                Python
                GitHub
                C++ (very optional, but is occasionally useful)
                Docker

                We use these technologies when we are developing our robot. Besides that, we also want to branch out in what
                we do, starting with redeveloping this very website! If you have some experience in web-development, or have
                any interest, please consider joining! We intend to use these languages:

                JavaScript/TypeScript (specifically for Svelte)
                Rust (optional, but also very cool!)

                Lastly, machine learning is an interest of ours, but it often takes up too much time given the team sizes we've
                had in the past. If you have experience in this and are interested in contributing, we would love to onboard you!
                If we were to implement machine learning, it would ideally be through Python. If you are interested in learning
                machine learning for the club, refer to the following technologies:

                Keras (lean more towards audio interpretation)
                Colaboratory/Jupyter

                Want to join? Send an email to our current programming team lead here: <a href="mailto:name@email.com">najman.husaini@utah.edu</a>
                We meet every week on Friday at 4pm in MEK 2445. Feel free to pass by if you want to see what we do before you apply!
